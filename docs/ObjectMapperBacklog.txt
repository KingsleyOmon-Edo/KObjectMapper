PENDING FEATURES
----------------
- Docs

- Data integrity Tests
	Identify the new nethods and for each:
	a) Happy paths 
	b) Sad paths
	b) Edge cases
	c) Where applicable test the types of supplied arguments

- Test guard clauses

- Mapping collections (More robust implementation)


 //  Map<T> Tests
    //  -------------
    //  Null source should throw
    //  Null target should throw
    //  If source not of type T throw
    //  If target not of the common expected type T throw.
    //  

3 - Test new method
	Remember to cover the newly extracted methods with enough tests.
	- WriteProperties
	- ApplyDiffs
	- Any other dangling method with little or zero code coverage

- Keep Extensions local

- Should return the mapped instance instead
	var target = mapper.Map<T>(source);
	var target = mapper.MapFrom<T>(source)
	var target = mapper.MapFrom(source);

- Review the semantics of the MapTo<T>() and MapFrom<T>() methods

- Mapping collections

COMPLETED FEATURES
-------------------
- POC: Basic mapping between two objects of same type. --- DONE
- Test strongly types mapping --- DONE
- Altenative signatures
	1 - MapTo<T>(T target)	--- DONE
	2 - MapFrom<T>(T source) --- DONE
	3 - Map(object source, object Target) --- DONE
	4 - MapTo(object source, object target) --- DONE
	5 - MapFrom(object source) --- DONE
	6 - Surface MapTo<T> and MapFrom<T> methods to any arbitray object via extension method for the generic variants --- DONE

- Map between two objects of dissimilar types.
- MapTo(), MapFrom()
- Surface Map methods to any arbitray object via extension methods
- Refactoring: Group funtionally related test methods together refactor to separate classes
- Separate MapToOfT from the lot into their own class
- Mapping collections (Initoal POC)
