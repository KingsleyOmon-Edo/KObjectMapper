PENDING FEATURES
-------------------
1 - Map between two objects of dissimilar types.
2 - Data integrity Tests, sad paths
3 - Test guard clauses
4 - Surface Map methods to any arbitray object via extension methods
5 - MapTo(), MapFrom()
6 - Keep Extensions local
7 - Should return the mapped instance instead
8 - Review the semantics of the MapTo<T>() and MapFrom<T>() methods
